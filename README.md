### Things I'd like to mention
- Firstly, I tried to implement front end, but I was kinda sucked.
- Secondly, I'm parsing all of the data available on hepsiburada.com. So I implemented a search function for checking if the tag is available in parsed list. If not, it returns to the N/A
- I also implemented the database[ *mongolab* ]. I will not remove the credentials, so you can check how it works. *A small reminder though, it's only small amount of storage.*
